            <p>I was born in Cincinnati,OH. My parents were in the Air Force. I grew up in a few different states and
                England.
                The places I have lived the most were Cincinnati, Dover, DE and England.
            </p><br>
            

            <p>Dover, DE known as the "small wonder"
                was a cool place to grow up. The pace of life there is slow and there is no sales tax and has beaches.
                I have traveled to some Eurepean countries.
            </p><br>
            

            <p>I enjoy learning about new technology and riding motorcycles. I have owned two sport bikes and would like to get another one.  Other hobbies in photography and some R/C
                (radio controlled vehicles).
            </p><br>
            

            <p>I have a 4yr old son. He is my mom's only grandchild. Due to this she has moved here, to Georgia to be
                closer to him (not me, I know the truth).
            </p><br>

            <p>Some of my family has moved from OH to Georgia as well. My brother and Grandmother made tthe move here.
                That means my son will know his great grandmother.  They live an hour away from and and my mom doesn't like to drive.  The plan is to move closer to her side of town.
